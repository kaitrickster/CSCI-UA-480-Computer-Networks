"""
The simulator first creates a Python object for the link (link), a Python
object for modeling the minimum RTT (pdbox), and a Python object to capture the
end hosts, i.e., the sender and the receiver (host).

There is no separate Python object for the sender and for the receiver. Both the
sender and the receiver are implemented within the same Python object called
host. host.send() is called when sending packets and host.recv() is called when
receiving ACKs for the packet an RTT (i.e., minimum RTT + queuing delay) later.

Similarly, there is no separate packet header format for packets and ACKs. They
are one and the same. The acknowledgement process works by calling host.recv()
on the same packet that was sent out as part of a host.send()in the past.

The code connects host to link, link to pdbox, and pdbox to host. Hence,
packets "flow" from host (where the send() method is called to send packets) to
link (where queues build up) to pdbox (where the packets incur a min.RTT worth
of delay) back to host (where the recv() method is called to process ACKs for
packets that were sent by host.send()).

The current value of time is represented by the variable tick, which is set in
the for loop and then passed to each of the objects within the simulator. If you
need to access the current value of time when implementing a protocol (e.g., for
computing RTT samples, or for setting the timestamp at which a packet was sent),
tick is the variable you should be using. You don't need to create your own
version of time.
